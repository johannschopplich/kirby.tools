::callout{icon="i-ri-question-line"}
We are currently working on a private Composer repository that will allow you to install the plugin using Composer. Please bear with us while we work on this feature. In the meantime, you can install the plugin manually. üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

#### Download

After your purchase, you will receive a download link for the Kirby Live Preview plugin. Download the ZIP file and extract it to your `site/plugins` folder. It should look like this:

```
site/plugins/
‚îú‚îÄ kirby-live-preview/
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ index.js
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ index.php
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ ‚Ä¶ other plugin files
```

### Step 2: Blueprint Setup

Select a site or page blueprint to which you want to add the Live Preview section. Add the following section configuration to the blueprint file:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
sections:
  livePreview:
    type: preview
```

### Step 3: Enjoy Real-Time Previews

Fit the Live Preview section to your blueprint layout and customize it to your needs: It can be part of any column and can even be sticky. The latter is useful for previewing content changes side-by-side with blocks or other fields:

```yaml [pages/default.yml]
columns:
  - width: 2/3
    fields:
      blocks:
        type: blocks

  - width: 1/3
    # Make the preview sticky
    sticky: true
    sections:
      livePreview:
        type: preview
```

Now you see a rendering of the page content. It updates as you type:

![Kirby Live Preview panel example](/img/kirby-live-preview-panel-example.png)

Try navigating through the preview ‚Äì if you click on a site link, such as in the header, the corresponding Panel page will open instead of the link in the preview.

For mor configuration options, see the [Configuration](/docs/live-preview/configuration) guide.
